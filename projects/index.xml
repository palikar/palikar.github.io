      <description>Abstract C++ is hard! C++ is even harder when you want to write good code. There are a lot of things to think about when you write code and if you don&amp;rsquo;t think about them, you are probably going to mess things up. Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve found that one good book (see references) that gives 42 (hehe!) concrete tips on how to be a better c++ programmer. This is my summary of sorts about the contents of said book.</description>
