      <description>Abstract In this post, I want to give a little more details on how Alisp can build from sources. ALisp is an interpreted language I&amp;rsquo;ve developed in C++. Over the last half a year, the project has become quite big (currently around 24K LOC) and thus the build process is so trivial as in the beginning. In the process of development, I&amp;rsquo;ve added numerous options for how the code can be compiled and all of those can be confusing at times.</description>

      <description>Abstract It&amp;rsquo;s has been a long standing idea of mine to just sit down and write a language. Not a complicated one, but also not completely useless one. Alisp is the crystallization of this idea into something concrete. It is a interpreted language based on Emacs-Lisp (elisp). I&amp;rsquo;ve borrowed a lot concepts from there and syntax-wise, Alisp closely follows elisp. By now the core runtime of the language is pretty feature complete and it is possible to run simple to moderately complicated programs.</description>
